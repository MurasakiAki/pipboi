# Modding your PIPBOI

For now you can moddify your PIPBOI with your extra functions.

Allowed languages are Python 3.x and Bash script.

## 1. Creating mod

1. In your IDE or text editor create your desirable new function for PIPBOI.
2. Have one main.py/.sh file ready for executing your mod.
3. You can also add info.txt file, where you can shortly describe what your mod does.
4. Make a folder for your mod, the folder name should be the name of your mod, the name should be original and should not be same as any other mod currently installed on your PIPBOI.
5. This is desirable structure of your mod folder:

> my_mod
>
> - /src (your source files)
> - /info.txt
> - /main.py/.sh \*

\* -> mandatory file

There is pre-installed **test** mod.

## 2. Creating mod in PIPBOI

You can create mods even in your PIPBOI.
You can use PIPBOIs text editor to create your scripts, and create your mod folder based on structure shown in section **1. Creating mod**.
After you're done developping, simply run command **_include [folder name]_** to include your mod folder into PIPBOI accessible mods.

## 3. Installing mods manually

If you have other mods downloaded you can include them into you PIPBOI by simply moving the mod folder into the **/mods** folder in your PIPBOI directory.
