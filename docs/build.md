# PIPBOI Build Tutorial

## Requirements:

(For PIPBOI MK1.x)

- RPi 3/4/5
- Waveshare 3.5" display
- Arduino (Using UNO R4 WiFi but other can be used too)
- Ultrasound sensor (HC-SRO4)
- Temperature/humidity sensor (DHT11)
- Optional tilt sensor (SW-520D)
- Any input device(Bluetooth mini keyboard recommended)

## Step 1:

(Assuming you have installed OS on your RPi)
With SSH or by plugging your RPi into a monitor, locate a tutorial how to setup your Waveshare display. It usually consists of downloading and installing drivers, so Internet connection is needed.

## Step 2:

With your display now running, you might want to change the resolution, if you're using the Waveshare 3.5" display the recommended resolution is 640x480.

## Step 3:

**Sensors and Arduino**

With wires and a breadboard connect Arduino and the sensors accordingly:
